*Learn how to use Tesbo framework to configure and run your Java automation testing scripts on the LambdaTest platform*

* [Running The Tesbo Test Automation Script On Online Selenium Grid](#running-the-tesbo-test-automation-script-on-online-selenium-grid)
* [Performing Parallel Testing With Online Selenium Grid](#performing-parallel-testing-with-online-selenium-grid)

## Prerequisites

* You would need Java development environment i.e. JDK 1.6 or higher. We recommend using the latest version.
* An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

## Running The Tesbo Test Automation Script On Online Selenium Grid


After you download or clone the LambdaTest-Tesbo Repository, you will find the test folder which would have your test files by the name [CheckBox.tests](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LamdaTest_Tesbo_Demo/blob/master/src/test/java/tests/CheckBox.tests) & [FormsAndList.tests](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LamdaTest_Tesbo_Demo/blob/master/src/test/java/tests/FormsAndList.tests).

Now that you have your test scripts ready with you, a few edits to the `config.json` is all that is required to run your test files over LambdaTest Selenium Grid. 

Let's have a look at how to edit these files.

**Step 1:** You need to specify the Selenium Address in your `config.json` that would point your tests to the Hub URL of LambdaTest Selenium Grid. Your Selenium Address would be:

```javascript
https://{LambdaTest_Username}:{LambdaTest_Access_Key}@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub
```

**Step 2:** In your `config.json` there is a config called "**IsGrid**". By default, IsGrid is set to false, make sure you set it as **true**.

```javascript
"IsGrid": true
```
**Step 3:** Define your desired capabilities. By defining your desired capabilities, you are informing the LambdaTest Selenium Grid about the configurations over which you wish your test automation script to run. You can take help from LambdaTest [Desired Capability Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator) to fetch the capabilities class.

Check out the complete [config.json](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LamdaTest_Tesbo_Demo/blob/master/config.json) file.

Now just hit the run button and you will find your test automation scripts running over the LambdaTest Selenium Grid.

## Performing Parallel Testing With Online Selenium Grid

You can leverage parallel testing to run multiple tests at the same time. To run parallel testing with Tesbo framework, you need to specify the count of parallel test in the config.json & set the parallel status to true.

```javascript
 "parallel": {
      "status": true,
      "count": "3"
    },
```

Now, if you wish to perform cross browser testing using the same script over different browsers in parallel then you need to define more capabilities in the config.json. 

Let's run the same script on three different browsers, simultaneously. We will run the script on Google Chrome 81 & Mozilla Firefox 76 on Windows 10. For macOS, we will take Safari 13.

```javascript
"capabilities": {
      "chrome": {
        "build" : "Tesbo_With_LambdaTest",
        "name" : "Tesbo",
        "platform": "Windows 10",
        "browserName": "Chrome",
        "version": "83.0"
      }
 
      "firefox": {
        "build" : "Tesbo_With_LambdaTest",
        "name" : "Tesbo",
        "platform": "Windows 10",
        "browserName": "Firefox",
        "version": "76.0"
      }
      "safari": {
        "build" : "Tesbo_With_LambdaTest",
        "name" : "Tesbo",
        "platform": "MacOS Catalina",
        "browserName": "Safari",
        "version": "13.0"
      }
    },
```

Here is the new config.json to run parallel testing with Tesbo & LambdaTest.

```javascript
{
  "run": {
    "baseUrl": "https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/",
    "seleniumAddress": "https://{userName}:{ApiKey}@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub",
    "by": {
      "tag": [
        "FO1"
      ]
    },
    "browser": {
      "name": [
        "chrome"
      ]
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "chrome": {
        "build" : "Tesbo_With_LambdaTest",
        "name" : "Tesbo",
        "platform": "Windows 10",
        "browserName": "Chrome",
        "version": "83.0"
      }

      "firefox": {
        "build" : "Tesbo_With_LambdaTest",
        "name" : "Tesbo",
        "platform": "Windows 10",
        "browserName": "Firefox",
        "version": "76.0"
      }
      "safari": {
        "build" : "Tesbo_With_LambdaTest",
        "name" : "Tesbo",
        "platform": "MacOS Catalina",
        "browserName": "Safari",
        "version": "13.0"
      }
    },

    "parallel": {
      "status": true,
      "count": "3"
    },
    "retryAnalyser":{
      "count":"0"
    },
    "binaries": {
      "chrome": ""
    },

    "highlightElement": true,
    "IsGrid": false
  },

  "cloudIntegration" : {
    "report": false,
    "apiKey": "d31129abe90e5e2086e56a26995cc1cc",
    "projectKey" : "5cd2e1f802d39139e8bf5092",
    "buildName":"QAbleTest001"
  }
}
```
